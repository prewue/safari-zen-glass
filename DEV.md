# DEV notes

Internals, measurements and dead ends behind this mod. Written so a future
session (human or AI) can pick it up without redoing the research. The source
files carry only short comments; everything that needs a paragraph is here, and
the comments point at the section that has it.

Everything below was measured on **macOS 26.5 (Tahoe)** with **Zen 1.21.15b**
(`XUL` built against SDK 26.5, arm64).

---

## 1. Window corner radius — `NSConvolutionOverride1`

`window-radius.uc.mjs` shells out to `/usr/bin/defaults` to set
`app.zen-browser.zen NSConvolutionOverride1 -float <r>`.

**The corner is already Apple's `.continuous` squircle.** Captured real windows
with their alpha channel, extracted the boundary with sub-pixel interpolation,
and fitted it against both CoreGraphics families:

| Window | continuous fit | circular fit | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| `O1=10` | rms 0.048, max 0.11 | rms 0.068, max 0.21 | continuous |
| `O1=18` | rms 0.057, max 0.18 | rms 0.119, max 0.44 | continuous |
| `O1=26` | rms 0.074, max 0.32 | rms 0.214, max 1.13 | continuous |
| `O1=45` | rms 0.146, max 1.02 | rms 0.480, max 3.73 | continuous |
| stock app A, no override | rms 0.074, max 0.32 | rms 0.214, max 1.13 | continuous |
| stock app B, no override | rms 0.074, max 0.32 | rms 0.214, max 1.13 | continuous |

rms is in points; 0.074pt is 0.15px at 2x, i.e. a pixel-exact match. So
`NSConvolutionOverride1` **only scales an already-continuous curve** — it does
not switch the shape.

`CGPathCreateWithContinuousRoundedRect(rect, 26, 26, NULL)` emits three cubic
Béziers per corner with an extent of `39.74529 = 1.528665 × 26`, exactly
`kCACornerCurveContinuous`.

**26 is the system default.** Two unmodified apps built against the macOS 26 SDK,
with no `NSConvolutionOverride1` set at all, measure identically to a window
forced to 26 — that is the control that rules out the override being the source
of the shape. Zen is built against SDK
26.5, so it inherits the same default — setting 26 is effectively a no-op that
just pins it. A test binary built against SDK 15.2 got 12 instead, so the
default is gated on build SDK, not on bundling.

Other findings:

- `NSConvolutionOverride2` exists in AppKit but has **no observable effect** on
  window corners (tested 0, 1, 26, 60 — radius and curve unchanged).
- `NSWindow._setCornerRadius:` at runtime produces geometry identical to the
  `defaults` route (extent 30.750, diagonal 7.585 at r=26), so a live,
  restart-free implementation via js-ctypes is possible if ever wanted.
- Apple's continuous corner best-fits CSS `superellipse(1.744)` (exponent
  3.3505), max deviation 0.19px at r=26. Useful if inner chrome corners ever
  need to match: pair it with `border-radius: 1.528665 × R`, since a CSS
  superellipse spans exactly its radius while Apple's curve spans 1.53×.
  Zen's engine does ship `corner-shape` behind `layout.css.corner-shape.enabled`.

## 2. Translucent sidebar — Zen's acrylic path

The transparency is **Zen's own**, not a CSS reimplementation.

`zen.theme.acrylic-elements` (default `false` in `firefox.js:1702`) drives two
things:

1. `ZenGradientGenerator.mjs:1235` returns the sidebar base colour at **0.6
   alpha instead of 1.0**, so the user's theme is recomputed translucent rather
   than discarded:
   ```js
   const opacity = this.#allowTransparencyOnSidebar ? 0.6 : 1;
   return this.isDarkMode ? [23, 23, 26, opacity] : [240, 240, 244, opacity];
   ```
   `#getSingleRGBColor` also shows that on macOS `canBeTransparent` is true, so
   the *main* background keeps its alpha while the *toolbar* is forced opaque
   until this flag is on.

2. `zen-compact-mode.css:16` swaps `#zen-toolbar-background` to a transparent
   background with
   `backdrop-filter: blur(42px) saturate(110%) brightness(0.25) contrast(100%)`.

### Two gotchas this mod works around

- **`brightness(0.25)` is a dark-mode hardcode.** In light mode it crushes the
  sidebar to near-black. `mod.safari.acrylic-tune` rebuilds the filter as
  `blur() saturate()` only.
- **The theme tint cannot be overridden naively.** `#zen-toolbar-background`
  paints the incoming theme on `::after` at `opacity: var(--zen-background-opacity)`
  and the outgoing one on `::before` at `calc(1 - var(--zen-background-opacity))`.
  That pair is Zen's workspace crossfade. Scale both by the same factor or the
  crossfade breaks:
  ```css
  &::after  { opacity: calc(var(--zen-background-opacity) * var(--tint)); }
  &::before { opacity: calc((1 - var(--zen-background-opacity)) * var(--tint)); }
  ```

### Read-once trap

`#allowTransparencyOnSidebar` is a **field initialiser** on
`ZenGradientGenerator` (`ZenGradientGenerator.mjs:83`), so the pref is read once
at construction. Toggling it at runtime updates the CSS but not the recomputed
theme colours, which strands the sidebar opaque with no way to toggle back.
Always require a full ⌘Q restart.

The layer itself is `display: none` outside compact mode — it only becomes
`display: flex` inside the compact-mode blocks (`zen-compact-mode.css:203,370`).

---

## 3. Content separation

`zen.theme.content-element-separation` (integer, Zen default **8**, capped at 12)
is set to `0` by `window-radius.uc.mjs`, gated on `mod.safari.flush-content`.

It has to be a pref, not a CSS override. `zenThemeModifier.js` does two things
with it:

```js
separation = Math.max(kMinElementSeparation, separation);   // kMin = 0.1px
document.documentElement.style.setProperty("--zen-element-separation", separation + "px");
if (separation == kMinElementSeparation) {
  document.documentElement.setAttribute("zen-no-padding", true);
} else {
  document.documentElement.removeAttribute("zen-no-padding");
}
```

So overriding `--zen-element-separation` in CSS would miss `zen-no-padding`,
which `zen-browser-container.css`, `zen-compact-mode.css`, `zen-glance.css`,
`zen-single-components.css` and `zen-split-view.css` all key off — including the
compact-mode corner-radius compensation. The variable is also clamped to 0.1px,
never actually 0.

It cannot go in `preferences.json` either. Sine converts pref value types via
`convertValueType`, which honours `"value": "num"`, but only in the *change*
handlers. The initial default write does not run it:

```js
if (save) ucAPI.prefs.set(pref.property, value);   // raw string
```

`ucAPI.prefs.set` picks its setter from `typeof value`, so that would call
`setStringPref` on an integer pref: it throws, gets swallowed by ucAPI's
try/catch, and the default silently never applies. Setting it from our own
script with `setIntPref` sidesteps the whole thing.

Turning the toggle off only clears the pref when the current value is `0`, so a
separation the user chose themselves is not clobbered.

The pref is observed live by `zenThemeModifier`, so no restart is needed.

## 4. Sidebar reveal animation

Zen's own rules, in `zen-compact-mode.css`:

```css
/* base / closing */
#navigator-toolbox:not([animate='true']) {
  transition: left 0.15s ease, right 0.15s ease, visibility 0.15s ease;
}

/* opening */
#navigator-toolbox:is([zen-has-hover], [zen-user-show], [zen-has-empty-tab],
                      [flash-popup], [has-popup-menu], [movingtab],
                      [zen-compact-mode-active]):not([animate='true']) {
  --zen-compact-mode-func: linear(0 0%, … 1.003423 100%);
  --zen-compact-mode-time: 0.25s;
  transition: left  var(--zen-compact-mode-time) var(--zen-compact-mode-func),
              right var(--zen-compact-mode-time) var(--zen-compact-mode-func);
}
```

Zen's stock curve overshoots only **0.34%** — under a pixel, so it reads flat.

This mod replaces both with an asymmetric pair. The open curve is the step
response of a damped harmonic oscillator, damping ratio **0.76**, response
**0.32s**, sampled into `linear()` at 50 points over **0.46s**:

- overshoot **2.54%** (≈8px on a 317px slide), peaking at 54% of the transition
- settles to within **0.33px** of target, so the forced `1.0000 100%` stop
  causes no visible snap
Closing is **0.30s** on `cubic-bezier(0.45, 0, 0.7, 0.55)`, no overshoot.

The original 0.19s `cubic-bezier(0.32, 0.72, 0, 1)` felt mismatched against the
open, and the duration was only half the reason — that curve is an *ease-out*,
so it covered 78% of the travel in the first quarter of the transition. The
panel effectively teleported and then crawled. The replacement is an ease-in:

| point of transition | 25% | 50% | 75% |
|---|---|---|---|
| old `cubic-bezier(0.32, 0.72, 0, 1)` | 0.779 | 0.955 | 0.992 |
| new `cubic-bezier(0.45, 0, 0.7, 0.55)` | 0.062 | 0.265 | 0.606 |

It leaves gently, builds speed, and is still accelerating when it clips past the
window edge. Because the travel is back-loaded, the perceived speed runs ahead
of the wall-clock duration — 0.30s here reads faster than 0.30s on a symmetric
curve would.

Zen synchronises companion elements with the toolbox by hand rather than through
a variable — `zen-compact-mode.css:196` carries `transition: visibility 0.15s`
on `#titlebar` with the comment *"Same as the toolbox"*. Retiming the close
without moving those desynchronises them: the panel keeps sliding while its
contents blank out at 0.15s, which looks like the sidebar vanishing mid-slide
with stray elements left behind. Both `#titlebar` and
`--zen-hidden-toolbar-transition-duration` now derive from
`--safari-close-time`, so changing the close duration moves everything at once.

A time-reversed critically damped spring was tried first, to keep the same
physical family as the open curve, and rejected: reversing a step response
inherits its long asymptotic tail as a *dead zone at the start* — only 0.7% of
the travel in the first quarter — which reads as input lag on exit.

Nearby options if the overshoot needs retuning: damping 0.78 → 6.3px,
0.74 → 10px, 0.72 → 12.2px.

**Cascade note.** The base and opening selectors differ only by `:is(...)`, so
both overrides carry `!important` and the opening rule wins during hover purely
on specificity (`:is()` contributes its most specific argument). `visibility` is
deliberately excluded from the opening transition, otherwise the panel flickers
at the start of the slide.

## 5. Folder motion and space swipe progress

### Folder motion

Zen runs three timings for one gesture: folder contents animate from JS
(`ZenFolders.mjs:1467/1537`) with a hardcoded `0.12s` / `easeInOut`, the folder
icon from CSS over `0.3s` (`zen-folders.css:120`), the space chevron over `0.1s`
(`zen-workspaces.css:695`). The icon finishing 2.5× after the thing it represents
is the visible part. The content duration is also fixed regardless of how much
content there is, so a two-tab folder and a fifteen-tab folder move at very
different speeds.

`folder-motion.uc.mjs` wraps `gZenUIManager.motion.animate` and recognises Zen's
folder calls by their exact signature (`duration: 0.12, ease: "easeInOut"`). Each
gets one duration from the folder's height — `0.18s + 0.0004s/px`, clamped to
`0.18–0.42s`, closing at 75 % of that — measured once per gesture and cached for
150 ms, so every item in a batch moves together. Opening gets a light spring
(`cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.26, 0.64, 1)`, 2.2 % overshoot peaking at 70 %); above 180px
the overshoot would be a large bounce, so a tall folder decelerates instead
(`0.22, 0.85, 0.3, 1`). Closing never overshoots (`0.25, 0.9, 0.35, 1`). Both are
fast off the mark: a folder toggle is a click. When the target carries an opacity,
the fade is staggered against the height — opening, the container leads and the
content fades in behind; closing, the content is gone before the container
finishes. The duration and easing go out as `--safari-folder-time` /
`--safari-folder-ease`, and chrome.css section 9 puts the icon and the chevron on
them.

The pinned-tabs section is left alone on purpose: animating it from here fought
Zen's own collapse and came out jerky in both directions.

### Space swipe progress

Zen never publishes how far a space swipe has travelled. `_handleSwipeUpdate`
computes the offset and passes it straight to
`_organizeWorkspaceStripLocations(workspace, justMove, offsetPixels)` as the
third argument, so wrapping that method is the only place the number is
readable. `folder-motion.uc.mjs` normalises it against the same strip width
`ZenSpacesSwipe` measures — `#navigator-toolbox` plus `#zen-sidebar-splitter` —
and writes it to `--safari-space-progress`.

Driving the blur off the attributes alone does not work, in either direction:

- `swipe-gesture` goes up the moment the fingers land and stays up for the
  whole drag, so it says nothing about distance and only produces a flash.
- `animating-background` covers the tail, and is cleared only after an awaited
  `Promise.race` (`ZenSpaceManager.mjs:2145`), so anything throwing before that
  leaves it set and the blur stuck.

Two resets are therefore mandatory. `active` moves to the new space *while*
`swipe-gesture` is still up (`ZenSpace.mjs:308`), so an observer on that
attribute zeroes the progress the instant a space stops being the one you are
leaving — otherwise the space already in view keeps the last progress value and
stays blurred. A watchdog zeroes it too, for a gesture that never fires its end
callback.

`--safari-space-track` is the blur's own transition duration: `0s` while a
finger is driving it, so the blur is locked to the movement, and a real
duration on commit so the reset eases rather than snaps.

## 6. Native `NSGlassEffectView` — superseded

This section used to call the native glass a dead end. It is not; section 12
has the working design and the measurements that overturned it. What still
stands from the first round:

- `NSGlassEffectView` exists on Tahoe, is a plain `NSView` subclass with
  `style` (0 regular, 1 clear), `cornerRadius`, `tintColor` and `contentView`,
  and can be created inside Zen's window.
- Zen's native view tree, from the window's content view down:

```
ToolbarWindow
  ZenWindowMaterialView [contentView, NSVisualEffectView, behind-window]
    ChildView                          <- Gecko's rendering surface
      ViewRegionContainerView          <- draggable regions
      ViewRegionContainerView          <- vibrancy regions
      PixelHostingView                 <- every rendered pixel
```

What was wrong: "Gecko composites alpha=255 across the entire surface" was
measured on the *window's* pixels, and an opaque `NSWindow` reports alpha 255
no matter what its layers hold. Gecko's own surface is transparent wherever
chrome CSS paints nothing (§12); the opaque pixels behind the panel were this
mod's section 10 toolbox background and Zen's layers, not the compositor.

---

## 7. Platform scope, and Sine's JS gate

Sine runs a mod's `.uc.mjs` scripts only when `sine.allow-unsafe-js` is true or the
mod's `origin` is `"store"` (`utils.sys.mjs:343`, `getScripts`). A GitHub install has
no origin, so without the pref every script here is silently skipped and only
`chrome.css` applies — the panel floats over Zen's flat fallback colours, the accent
never appears, the window corners stay Zen's. The README walks the user through the
switch (Settings → Sine → General, "Enable installing JS from unofficial sources"); a
test profile needs the pref in its `user.js` too.

Only the window corner radius is macOS-specific — it shells out to
`/usr/bin/defaults` and self-guards on `Services.appinfo.OS === "Darwin"`. The
sidebar shape, the acrylic tuning and the reveal animation are plain CSS and
work wherever Zen runs, so the mod carries no `os` field in `theme.json` and the
corner-radius setting is labelled macOS-only instead.

Sine's platform gating, for reference:

- `theme.json` → `os: ["macos"]` filters the mod out of the marketplace listing
  (`marketplace.sys.mjs:195`).
- `preferences.json` → `disabledOn: ["windows", "linux"]` hides an individual
  setting (`preferences.sys.mjs:136`).

Both compare against `ucAPI.utils.os`, which is `AppConstants.platform.slice(0, 3)`
— i.e. `mac`, `win`, `lin` — matched as a substring.

---

## 8. Pinned sidebar panel

`mod.safari.pinned-panel`, chrome.css section 10 (plus 3b for the inner padding),
and `page-canvas.uc.mjs` with its actor pair for the colour of the gap.

### The panel is already built, it is just hidden

Compact mode's floating panel is one element: `#zen-toolbar-background`, the first
child of `#titlebar` (`browser.xhtml:6518`, `class="zen-toolbar-background
zen-browser-generic-background"`). Everything that makes it look like a panel is
declared at the **top level** of `zen-compact-mode.css:8-34` — outside any
`[zen-compact-mode]` selector:

```css
.zen-toolbar-background {
  display: none;
  box-shadow: var(--zen-big-shadow);
  background: light-dark(#e9e9e9, #131313);
  @media -moz-pref('zen.theme.acrylic-elements') {
    background: transparent;
    backdrop-filter: blur(42px) saturate(110%) brightness(0.25) contrast(100%) !important;
  }
  &::before, &::after {
    outline: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, .15);
    background-attachment: fixed !important;
    background-size: 100vw 100vh !important;
  }
  &, &::before, &::after {
    border-radius: calc(var(--zen-native-inner-radius) - var(--zen-compact-mode-no-padding-radius-fix, 0px));
  }
}
```

The only thing keeping it off screen outside compact is `display: none` on line 9.
Compact turns it on with a single declaration, `zen-compact-mode.css:203-205`.

The colours are live too. `ZenGradientGenerator.mjs:1730-1733` writes
`--zen-main-browser-background-toolbar` to that element **unconditionally**, not
inside a compact-mode branch, and `zen-browser-ui.css:67-84` is what paints it onto
`::after` / `::before`. So in the pinned layout the layer is fully painted and
current — it is simply not displayed. That is why this is a display toggle rather
than a reimplementation, and why the workspace crossfade and the section 8 swipe
blur keep working untouched.

`#navigator-toolbox` itself paints nothing in either mode:
`background: var(--zen-navigator-toolbox-background, transparent) !important`
(`zen-browser-ui.css:12-16`), and `--zen-navigator-toolbox-background` is never
assigned anywhere in the tree. Both modes rely entirely on the panel element.

### The panel has to be re-parented by CSS, not by DOM

`ZenUIManager.mjs:1374-1380` moves two elements depending on the mode:

```js
if (isCompactMode) {
  titlebar.moveBefore(navBar, titlebar.firstChild);
  titlebar.moveBefore(topButtons, titlebar.firstChild);
} else {
  titlebar.parentNode.moveBefore(topButtons, titlebar);
  titlebar.parentNode.moveBefore(navBar, titlebar);
}
```

So in compact `#nav-bar` and `#zen-sidebar-top-buttons` live **inside** `#titlebar`,
and the panel — a child of `#titlebar` — covers the whole sidebar. Pinned, they are
moved **out**, becoming siblings placed before it. Turning the panel on and leaving
it there would cover the tab strip only, with the window buttons and the urlbar
sitting outside it.

Moving the element in the DOM would mean a script, and one that has to undo itself
on `ZenCompactMode:Toggled`. It is not necessary. The panel is
`position: absolute; inset: 0`, so it sizes to the padding box of its nearest
**positioned ancestor** — which does not have to be its parent. Compact positions
`#titlebar` (`zen-compact-mode.css:194`); section 10 leaves `#titlebar` static and
positions `#navigator-toolbox` instead, and the panel spreads over the entire
sidebar without anything being moved.

### Stacking

`z-index: -1` on the panel (`zen-compact-mode.css:13`) only means "behind the
sidebar's own content" if the sidebar is a stacking context. Compact gets one for
free from `position: fixed; z-index: 10`. Pinned, `#navigator-toolbox` is
`position: inherit` (`zen-browser-ui.css:18-21`) off a static parent, so a `-1`
child would escape upward and land behind `#zen-browser-background` — which is
`position: absolute; z-index: 0` (`zen-browser-ui.css:40-45`) and covers the whole
window — i.e. the panel would be painted and invisible.

`position: relative; z-index: 1` on the toolbox fixes both halves at once: it makes
the stacking context that traps the `-1`, and it puts the sidebar on the same layer
as `#zen-appcontent-wrapper` (`zen-browser-ui.css:165-166`), above the gradient.

### Origin trap: Sine sheets are USER_SHEET

`stylesheets.sys.mjs` registers the aggregate mod stylesheet with

```js
window.windowUtils.loadSheet(this.#chromeURI, window.windowUtils.USER_SHEET);
```

so everything in `chrome.css` is **user origin**, and the cascade puts author
normal *above* user normal:

```
UA normal < user normal < author normal < author important < user important
```

A plain declaration here therefore loses to any Zen rule that touches the same
property, no matter how specific ours is. Two of this section's three key
declarations are exactly that case and silently did nothing until they were
marked `!important`:

| ours | Zen's, which was winning |
|---|---|
| `display: flex` on the panel | `.zen-toolbar-background { display: none }` (`zen-compact-mode.css:9`) |
| `position: relative` on the toolbox | `#nav-bar, #navigator-toolbox { position: inherit }` (`zen-browser-ui.css:18-21`) |

The symptom is a pinned sidebar that looks completely untouched — no panel and
no float — while the stylesheet is demonstrably loaded and the pref is set. It
is also why nearly every rule in this mod carries `!important`, and why the
glass-control rules in section 6 do not need it: those declare properties on an
`::after` the mod itself creates, so no author rule competes.

### Geometry, and what has to be behind the panel

Compact insets the panel by **float/2 on all four sides**, but reaches that number
three different ways (`zen-compact-mode.css:124-158`):

| side | how compact gets there | result |
|---|---|---|
| left | `left: -float/2` against `padding: 0 float` | float/2 |
| right | same padding, `--actual-zen-sidebar-width` wide | float/2 |
| top | `top: float/2` | float/2 |
| bottom | `height: 100% - float` | float/2 |

Pinned, `#navigator-toolbox` is an ordinary flex child of `<hbox flex="1" id="browser">`
(`browser.xhtml:6081`; every XUL element is `display: flex`, `xul.css:18-21`), so the
same inset is one even value on the box itself — and it is also what pushes the page
aside, the toolbox being in flow rather than fixed.

The obvious way to write that is a margin, and it is wrong. **Margins are not
painted.** With a margin the gap around the panel shows whatever is underneath the
sidebar column, which is `#zen-browser-background` — the workspace gradient — and the
panel ends up framed in a colour compact never has behind it.

The gap is dropped on the page-facing side — the panel runs straight up to the page
there, with only its inner spacing left — so `inset-inline-end` goes to 0 and the
padding on that side carries the inner value alone. Both flip for a right-hand sidebar.

The numbers: section 1 sets `--zen-compact-float` to 14px, so the gap on the outer sides
is 7px in both modes (22px until the second round asked for 4px less). Section 1's
selector carries `:root` because a `userChrome.css` in the profile sets the same
variable on `#navigator-toolbox` with `!important`, is a user sheet just like Sine's, and
with equal origin and importance only specificity decides.

### The panel's corner follows the window's

A panel with a circular 22px corner inside a window with Apple's continuous 26px corner
and a 7px gap is not concentric: along the diagonal the gap grows to 8–10px and the two
curves are visibly different shapes. The fix is the one Apple uses for nested continuous
corners — the same curve family, at the outer radius minus the inset:

```css
:root[safari-window-radius] #zen-toolbar-background, &::before, &::after {
  corner-shape: superellipse(1.744);
  border-radius: calc((var(--safari-window-radius) - var(--zen-compact-float) / 2) * 1.528665);
}
```

`window-radius.uc.mjs` publishes the radius it sets as `--safari-window-radius` and the
attribute that gates the rule, so a build with no native radius (any other platform, or
the toggle off) keeps Zen's own panel radius. `superellipse(1.744)` and the `1.528665`
factor are the fit from §1: a CSS superellipse spans exactly its radius while Apple's
curve spans 1.53×, so a nominal 19px continuous corner is `border-radius: 29px` with that
shape — verified in the computed style (`29.0446px`, `superellipse(1.744)` on the panel
and both pseudo-elements). `layout.css.corner-shape.enabled` is `true` by default in this
build (`greprefs.js:1607`), so no pref is touched. Zen's own
`--zen-compact-mode-no-padding-radius-fix` no longer applies to the panel; it compensated
compact's panel against the page card, which the concentric formula makes moot.
`--zen-border-radius` (section 2, 24px) stays for everything else Zen rounds with it.

Otherwise the gap is padding, the toolbox paints it, and the panel is inset back out
of it:

```css
--safari-pin-gap: calc(var(--zen-compact-float) / 2);
padding: calc(var(--safari-pin-gap) + <inner spacing>);
#zen-toolbar-background { inset: var(--safari-pin-gap) !important; }
```

`inset: 0` resolves against the **padding box**, which is why it has to be overridden
at all — left alone the panel would cover the gap it is supposed to float inside.

That leaves the question of what colour the toolbox paints. Compact's panel does not
float over the gradient: with flush content the page card spans the whole window and
the compact toolbox is `position: fixed; z-index: 10`, above `#zen-appcontent-wrapper`,
so **the page is what is behind the panel** — both in the gap around it and under its
`backdrop-filter`.

A fixed light/dark pair is not close enough. It matches a default page and nothing
else: GitHub in dark mode is `#0d1117`, against a hardcoded `#202020` that is plainly a
different colour, and the gap goes back to reading as a frame. So the colour is
sampled live — see below — and the static pair survives only as the fallback:

```css
background: var(--safari-pin-canvas, rgb(255, 255, 255)) !important;
@media (-moz-content-prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  background: var(--safari-pin-canvas, rgb(32, 32, 32)) !important;
}
```

Those fallbacks are the values Zen paints content with
(`zen-browser-container.css:16-18`). The media query is deliberate: `light-dark()` on a
chrome element resolves against the *chrome* colour scheme, so a light page under dark
chrome would come out dark. `-moz-content-prefers-color-scheme` is the content-side
one, the same signal `env(-moz-content-preferred-color-scheme)` carries.

`--tabpanel-background-color` (`content-area.css:11-13`, `#f9f9fb` / `#2b2a33`) also
tracks the content scheme and would serve as a fallback, but it is Firefox's newtab
canvas colour, not the one Zen actually paints `browser[type="content"]` with.

### Asking the page: `page-canvas.uc.mjs` and its actor pair

The gap has to be the colour of the page canvas, and it has to become that colour in
the frame the page appears — not before, not after. Those are two separate questions,
and neither can be answered from the parent process.

**What.** The surface the panel floats beside, resolved from layout in the content
process (`page-canvas-child.sys.mjs`). At three points one CSS pixel in from the edge
on the sidebar's side — 25 % / 55 % / 85 % of the viewport height — `elementsFromPoint`
gives the stack of boxes under the point, top to bottom, and the topmost one with an
opaque background **that spans at least 90 % of the viewport height** is the surface.
`<html>` and `<body>` count whatever their box says, because CSS propagates their
background to the canvas; when nothing under the point is opaque, `<body>`'s background
is still consulted for the same reason (a short page, where the point lies outside the
body box). Two of three agreeing is the answer.

The height test is the whole difference between a steady gap and a nervous one. The
first design took the first opaque box under the point, whatever its size, and on a
live page that is whatever the page put there: a list row scrolling past, a hover
highlight, a toast. `safari-canvas.log` from a real session showed the consequence —
on one page, **nine changes in seven seconds**, flipping between the canvas and a row
colour (`rgb(246, 246, 246)` ↔ `rgb(255, 255, 255)`). A box that spans the viewport is a
surface — the canvas, an app root, a sidebar, a drawer — and a surface only changes
colour when the page restyles it.

This is deliberately *not* the CSS canvas colour either, which was the very first actor
design and is wrong more often than it sounds: a great many apps leave `<body>` white
and paint a dark root `<div>` over it (`agent.pollyreach.ai/auth` was the one that
showed it), and the canvas is then a colour nobody sees. Reading the stack finds the
div; reading the canvas finds the white.

A translucent or image layer is not stepped over on the way down. What shows through
it is a blend only pixels know, so the point is reported as unresolvable — "image" or
"translucent" — and the parent reads pixels, once, after the paint. An earlier version
continued past such layers to the solid colour beneath, which on a page with a gradient
body over a white `<html>` reported white for a surface that was plainly not white.

The edge follows the sidebar: `zen.tabs.vertical.right-side` is mirrored into content
processes like any pref, so the child reads it itself and samples the right edge for a
right-hand sidebar; the parent watches `zen-right-side` on `:root` and asks again when
it flips.

**When.** `MozAfterPaint`, listened for on the content window's `windowRoot` from a
`JSWindowActorChild`. It fires once a paint has been *composited*, so the first one for
a new document is the frame in which that document replaced the previous one on screen.
This is the in-tree pattern for "the page is now visible" — Firefox has no single event
for it and composes it the same way:

| in-tree user | what it gates on it |
|---|---|
| `LoginManagerChild.sys.mjs:1707-1773` | the first form fill: `DOMContentLoaded` → `windowRoot` `MozAfterPaint` → `visibilityState === "visible"`; the `TODO: Bug 1983533` beside it says there is no chrome-only event for this |
| `DOMFullscreenChild.sys.mjs:124-156` | reporting a finished fullscreen transition, with `event.transactionId > windowUtils.lastTransactionId` |
| `AboutReaderChild.sys.mjs:186-210` | the readability check, with `event.clientRects.length` as "did *my* document paint" |

`dom.send_after_paint_to_content` does not get in the way. It withholds the event from
web-page JS; privileged listeners in the content process are not what it gates, and
none of the three above consult it.

Not every `MozAfterPaint` is a paint of the page, though, and two tests sort out the
ones that are not. Gecko fires it for a tick that had invalidations but sent no
transaction, and — while painting is still suppressed for a new document — for a
transaction that composites nothing, leaving the `<browser>` element's own grey
background on screen. First: the event carries `transactionId`, and the child records
`windowUtils.lastTransactionId` when it arms the listener and ignores anything at or
below it (`DOMFullscreenChild.sys.mjs:147-150`). Second: the event has to have painted
rectangles of its own — `event.clientRects.length`, the discriminator
`AboutReaderChild.sys.mjs:210` uses — so an empty composite is skipped and the first one
that actually paints is taken. That first painted frame is the document's *first paint*,
the moment its background reaches the screen, which is exactly what to match.

First *contentful* paint was tried for the second test and was wrong. It waits for the
first frame with real content, which on a heavy dark app lands seconds after the dark
background is already showing — so the gap sat on the previous page's colour for the
whole load. Measured: swapping it for `clientRects` cut the gap-behind-page lag on a
light→dark navigation from ~250ms to one or two compositor frames. `load` forces the
flag on as a backstop for a document that somehow never delivered a painted event.

The listener is armed, not permanent. It is on from the document's creation
(`DOMWindowCreated`, before any paint) until two seconds after `load`, and again for two
seconds whenever something that could move the colour happens: an attribute change on
`<html>` or `<body>` (theme toggles flip a class there), a child added to `<head>` (a late
stylesheet), `pageshow` (bfcache), the document becoming visible, or the parent asking.
Outside those windows nothing runs. The first painted frame is read at once. After it,
a paint whose `clientRects` do not reach into the 8px strip at the sampled edge cannot
have changed the surface and is not read at all, and the rest are coalesced to one read per 40 ms with a
trailing read, so a burst of paints costs one `elementsFromPoint` pass and the last one
wins. A report is sent only when the answer changes, so a load is one message.

**`Cu.now()` no longer exists**, and this bit hard. The first version of the child
timed its windows with it. Gecko removed it; the calls throw `TypeError: Cu.now is not
a function`. Because `#onPaint` reported *before* it checked the window, the report
went out and the throw landed on the disarm — the listener never came off, every paint
of every page was read for the life of the document, and `actorCreated` failed outright
for a document that was already complete. That, with the edge-pixel reading above, is
most of what the "jumpy gap" was. `ChromeUtils.now()` is the replacement everywhere.

**A pixel re-read is compared with tolerance.** Two `drawSnapshot` reads of the same
gradient a moment apart differ by a few units — `rgb(10, 12, 62)` on a switch to GitHub's
home, `rgb(7, 9, 63)` from the confirm query 20 ms later — and applying the second is a
visible flick for no information. A pixel answer within 12 units per channel of the
colour already cached for the browser keeps the cached one.

**The parent applies, it does not decide.** `page-canvas.uc.mjs` writes the variable
when the *selected* browser reports, and on `TabSelect` from a per-browser `WeakMap`,
synchronously in the handler. A same-document location change — an SPA route — creates
no document and so no first paint, but may restyle; the parent nudges the page to watch
its next few paints (`Canvas:Refresh`). A `prefers-color-scheme` flip drops the cache and
nudges with `force`, so the page answers even if the colour is the same.

**Routing the report needs the reliable window handle.** The parent turns a report into
a `CustomEvent` on the chrome window, reached as `browsingContext.topChromeWindow`. That
matters: `top.embedderElement`, the obvious way to the `<browser>`, is intermittently
null exactly during a process switch — the very moment reports are flowing — and a parent
that keyed off it silently dropped every push and fell back to a network milestone. This
cost a long debugging round; `topChromeWindow` stays valid through the switch, and the
push arrives.

**The wash is for an empty tab, not a `transparent` browser.** When style names no
colour and the tab is genuinely Zen's empty tab, the gap shows the same wash the CSS
fallback does. The signal for "empty" is the tab's `zen-empty-tab` attribute, kept
current by `#changeToEmptyTab`. The `<browser>` element's `transparent="true"` looks
tempting and is wrong: Zen sets it when a tab is *created* empty and never clears it on
navigation (`tabbrowser.js:2960`), so a page opened from a new tab still carries it —
keying the wash off it washed real pages grey, which is exactly the bug that showed on
YouTube opened from a fresh tab.

**Layers, not just paint.** Across a process switch — every cross-site navigation, with
Fission — the compositor briefly has nothing for the browser and the `<browser>` shows
its own placeholder while the new process paints into layers nobody is showing yet. The
parent can tell — `browser.hasLayers`, and `MozLayerTreeReady` when it flips
(`AsyncTabSwitcher.sys.mjs:158`) — so a colour for a browser without layers is held and
applied on that event. The same holds on a switch to a tab whose background layers were
dropped: applying the cached colour in the `TabSelect` handler would lead the switch by
the wait, so it defers too; measured, the event lands 15–30 ms after the switch.

The hold is *not* released on a short timeout. An earlier version gave up after 600 ms
and applied anyway, on the reasoning that the tab switcher stops waiting after 400 ms —
but that reasoning is about tab switches, and on an in-place navigation to a heavy site
the new process can take longer than that to produce its first frame. Applying then is
exactly the artefact where the gap turns the new page's colour while the page area is
still showing the placeholder. Now the wait re-checks `hasLayers` at 2.5 s and only
forces the colour on at 6 s, as insurance against a browser that never reports layers;
in practice the event always comes first.

**No network milestone drives the colour.** An earlier version re-queried the page at the
end of the load (`STATE_STOP | STATE_IS_NETWORK`) as a safety net. It was removed: on a
page that streams — YouTube, Gmail — that milestone fires long before the content paints,
and applying its answer put the new colour in the gap a second or more before the page
appeared. The paint push is the only thing that changes the colour on a load now;
`TabSelect` reads the per-browser cache and confirms it with a `ready`-gated query.

Nothing is ever cleared while running. Handing the variable back to the CSS fallback is
itself a visible jump — to grey, under a dark content scheme.

**Traps, all of which bit once:**

- The initial document of every navigation is `about:blank`, and it fires `load` and
  `pageshow` like any other. `document.isInitialDocument` is the precise test; the
  child skips those documents outright.
- A document loading in a background tab never paints, so a paint-driven report would
  never come. The child sends its colour on `load` when `document.hidden`; that colour is
  not on screen, so sending it costs nothing visible, and it is what makes the eventual
  switch synchronous.
- `browser.tabs.remote.warmup.enabled` is on by default: a tab the pointer hovers over
  is warmed and *does* paint in the background. Reports from it land in the cache and
  are applied only if the browser is the selected one.
- The actor can be created late — the parent asking about a page that was open before
  the mod started, or `DOMContentLoaded` / `load` arriving on a document that was
  already here when the actor was registered, which is every tab a session restores
  (the mod starts 800 ms after the window's `load`, and restored tabs are well under way
  by then). Such a document's first paint is behind it, and a page that has finished
  drawing paints no more, so nothing would ever trigger a read: the child reports at
  once when created on a document past `loading`, and again at `load` if no paint was
  seen since it armed. Before this, a restored tab whose page was painted and idle by
  the time the parent asked answered `ready: false` and then waited for a paint that
  never came — the gap stayed on the fallback until a reload, and the user's own log
  shows `skip not-ready` at 1.1 s followed by the first `apply` at 5.9 s or never.
- `drawSnapshot`'s rect is in content CSS pixels; `getBoundsWithoutFlushing` is chrome
  pixels. Divide by `browser.fullZoom` or the lowest sample falls off a zoomed page's
  viewport and reads as unpainted.
- `safeForUntrustedWebProcess: true` is mandatory or the actor is never created on an
  ordinary site and fails silently. The actor modules are reachable at
  `chrome://sine/content/<id>/…` via the profile's `chrome.manifest`
  (`content sine ../sine-mods/`); derive the URLs from `import.meta.url`, since the
  folder is whatever id Sine fixed at first install. They must *not* be listed in
  `theme.json`'s `scripts`, or Sine imports them once as background modules.
- The actor modules are cached by the module loader for the life of the process.
  Sine's "Refresh mod styles" re-runs `page-canvas.uc.mjs` but not the `.sys.mjs`
  files; an edit to either actor needs a restart.
- The content process sandbox only reads the actor modules from *inside* the profile.
  A `sine-mods/<id>` that is a symlink to a checkout elsewhere loads the `.uc.mjs`
  scripts fine (parent process) and fails the child modules silently — the console
  says `Failed to load chrome://sine/content/<id>/page-canvas-child.sys.mjs` and nothing
  else. Copy, do not link.

`mod.safari.pinned-panel.debug` (hidden, boolean) logs every report and every write
with a timestamp in the Browser Toolbox console. A navigation should be one `apply`
line; scrolling, video, and a live page should be none.

### The whole window, not just the gap

Painting only the gap left one seam: on a load the gap took the new colour a beat before
the page did, so for that beat a page-coloured strip sat beside Zen's grey content
placeholder. Rather than chase that beat down to zero, the page area is painted the same
colour, so there is no strip to notice — the window changes as one surface.

The lever is not transparency. Making the content `<browser>` transparent so the window
shows through would work but is a broad, risky change — the gradient would bleed on any
page without an opaque background, and video, PDF and translucent documents would all be
affected; Zen restricts transparent content browsers to the empty tab for exactly these
reasons. Nothing here is made transparent; two opaque surfaces are repainted with
`--safari-pin-canvas`.

Which surface actually shows during a load is not obvious, and guessing it wrong wasted a
round. The instinct is the `<browser>`'s own placeholder — Zen paints
`browser[type="content"]:not([transparent="true"])` a flat `light-dark(#fff, #202020)`
(`zen-browser-container.css:16-18`) — so that is repainted too. But a diagnostic fill
(browser magenta, the container behind it lime) showed the truth: on a cross-process
navigation the new document has no layers yet, the `<browser>` paints nothing, and what
shows through is **`#tabbrowser-tabpanels`**, the container Zen leaves transparent
(`zen-browser-ui.css:7-9`) — it came up lime, never magenta. That transparent container
was the black/grey frame the page area showed. So it is painted `--safari-pin-canvas` as
well, and between the two the content area carries the page colour whether the browser is
painting a placeholder or nothing at all. Both are opaque, so nothing composites through
and video, PDF and images are untouched; the page's own paint covers them exactly, since
that variable is what it was sampled from, so gap and page move as one.

Both fills are held off the empty tab (`&:not([zen-has-empty-tab="true"])`), where the
workspace gradient is meant to show through Zen's wash. **Not** off the browser's own
`[transparent="true"]`, which is what the first version keyed the placeholder on, and
which is why a page opened from a new tab showed a grey page area beside a page-coloured
gap while it loaded. Zen sets `transparent` on a browser created for the empty tab and
never clears it on navigation (`tabbrowser.js:2960`); a site opened from that tab keeps
the attribute for life, the placeholder override skipped it, and across the process
switch into the site what showed in the page area was the gradient under Zen's wash —
grey — while the gap already carried the site's dark colour from the paint report.
Keying both fills off `:root`'s `zen-has-empty-tab` paints the placeholder the page
colour on every browser that is showing a page, transparent or not.

The empty tab itself is handled on `TabSelect` in the parent, without asking the page:
its actor never activates on an initial `about:blank`, and the answer is known anyway.
The wash is written into `--safari-pin-canvas` rather than left to the CSS branch, so
that the moment the tab starts navigating and the empty-tab branch drops away, gap and
placeholder are still the wash and the next change is the new page's own first paint —
one change, not two.

### Measuring it, at last

Every earlier round was steered by prose descriptions of a sub-second event, and each
fix traded one artefact for another because nobody could see the frame. This one was
measured. A WebDriver BiDi session drives Zen over `--remote-debugging-port` (navigate a
tab, switch tabs), and a Quartz `CGWindowListCreateImage` loop samples the gap pixel and
a page column off the driven window at ~25 fps, while the mod appends every decision to
`safari-canvas.log` with a `performance.now()` stamp. Aligning the two on the navigation
instant turns "it leads" into a number: on a white→YouTube navigation the gap now trails
the page by ~0.2 s rather than leading it, and a return to a backgrounded YouTube tab
applies `rgb(15,15,15)` on `layers-ready`, never the wash. `mod.safari.pinned-panel.debug`
turns the log on; the child's own per-paint trace is behind a `DEBUG` constant in
`page-canvas-child.sys.mjs`, off by default because it is a flood.

The rework of both features was measured without pixels, in an isolated profile,
because the same question — how many times did it change, and when — can be answered
from the chrome window alone. The recipe, for next time:

- A throwaway profile with the user's `chrome/JS` and `chrome/utils` (the Sine engine)
  copied in, a `chrome/sine-mods/mods.json` holding one entry for this mod with
  `"no-updates": true`, the mod's files **copied** into `chrome/sine-mods/<id>/` (see the
  sandbox trap above), and a `user.js` carrying the `zen.*`, `mod.safari.*` and `sine.*`
  prefs from the real profile plus `mod.safari.pinned-panel.debug`.
- Zen started with `-marionette -remote-allow-system-access -no-remote -profile <dir>`.
  Without `-remote-allow-system-access` the chrome context is refused; the command to
  enter it is `Marionette:SetContext`, not `WebDriver:SetContext`, in this build.
- A probe installed in the chrome window with `WebDriver:ExecuteScript`: a 16 ms
  interval that records every change of `--safari-pin-canvas`, `--safari-accent-top`,
  `[safari-accent]` and the current URL against `performance.now()`. Navigations go
  through `openTrustedLinkIn(url, "current")` and `gBrowser.addTab`, tab switches by
  element reference — `gBrowser.tabs[i]` is not stable under Zen's own reordering.
- One Marionette session at a time: a client that dies without closing its socket
  leaves the session active and every later connection is refused with "an active
  session has been found".

The result the rework was accepted on, from that harness: one `apply` per document on
seven sites, none on a same-origin navigation or a reload, `layers-ready` 15–30 ms after
every tab switch, and a sidebar accent that changed exactly once per new site and not
at all within one.

### Dead end: chasing the load-time jump from the parent

Before the actor, the colour came from three 1×1 `drawSnapshot` pixels down the left
edge, sampled on `TabSelect`, `onLocationChange` and `STATE_STOP`. It was stable
*enough* on a quiet page and had a flash during every load; eight attempts to remove
the flash from the parent side made things worse and were reverted. Do not retry them
— this is what happened, and why none of it could have worked.

**The random jumping had a mundane cause.** `onStateChange` was gated on bare
`STATE_STOP`, which fires for every finished request — images, XHR, beacons, ad
frames, media segments — not just the document. Each one re-sampled the left edge
180ms later, and on a live page the left edge is never the same twice. The
`LOCATION_CHANGE_SAME_DOCUMENT` filter was missing as well, so every SPA route change
cleared the cache and sampled again. Filtering those (`STATE_IS_NETWORK`,
`isTopLevel`, the same-document flag) is the minimal fix if the actor ever has to go;
it removes the jumping and keeps the load-time flash.

**The flash could not be fixed from the parent at all.** `drawSnapshot` rasterises the
*document*, not what the compositor has on screen; Gecko holds the previous frame until
the new document is worth showing, so the colour is readable long before any of it is
visible — about a second on a slow site. Every parent-side substitute for "the page is
now visible" is a network milestone, and the network is not the renderer:

| gate | why it fails |
|---|---|
| `isLoadingDocument` clearing | that is the load event, subresources included; heavy pages are on screen seconds earlier |
| `STATE_STOP \| STATE_IS_DOCUMENT` | a page that streams its markup — YouTube — keeps that request open long past first paint |
| an origin cache applied on `onLocationChange` | changes the colour *at* the navigation, a second before the page |
| `transition` on the toolbox background | a slower jump, not a fix |

There is no parent-process signal for a content paint. `MozAfterPaint` in the chrome
window belongs to the chrome window; `MozLayerTreeReady` tracks whether a remote
browser has *any* layers and is a tab-switch signal, not a navigation one
(`tabbrowser.js:2785-2790` re-triggers it by hand on remoteness change);
`MozAfterRemotePaint` and `requestNotifyAfterRemotePaint` no longer exist in Gecko 154;
and `AsyncTabSwitcher.sys.mjs:1402-1406` says outright that "the parent process might not
even get MozAfterPaint delivered" for a remote child's first paint.

**The first actor attempt used the wrong signal.** It reported on `DOMContentLoaded` +
`requestAnimationFrame`. rAF callbacks run on every refresh-driver tick, including the
ticks during which painting is still suppressed and the old page is still on screen —
so it led the paint just as the parent did, and it never ran at all for a background
tab. Its other flickers had ordinary causes that are handled above: reporting from the
initial `about:blank`, and clearing the variable on a "no answer".

### The splitter has to stop taking space

`#zen-sidebar-splitter` is not decoration: it is a real flex sibling, created in JS
(`ZenCustomizableUI.sys.mjs:51-56`), re-anchored after the toolbox on every layout
pass (`ZenUIManager.mjs:1505-1508`), and sized `min/max-width:
var(--zen-toolbox-padding) !important` (`vertical-tabs.css:874-884`) — 6px on macOS.

Left in flow it adds a second gap after the padded one, and that gap lies outside the
toolbox, so nothing paints it: a 6px stripe of gradient between the panel and the
page. Pulling it back over the toolbox by its own width
(`margin-inline-start: calc(-1 * var(--zen-toolbox-padding))`, mirrored for a
right-hand sidebar) takes it out of the layout while leaving the grab area exactly
where the eye expects it. Resizing is unaffected — the splitter drives the toolbox's
persisted `style.width`, not its own box.

Compact never hits this because it hides the splitter outright
(`zen-compact-mode.css:65`) and gives up resizing along with it. Keeping it is the
payoff for not pinning compact open.

### Surviving the compact-mode toggle

`gZenCompactModeManager` flips `zen-compact-mode` in the `preference` setter and only
*then* calls `_updateEvent()` → `animateCompactMode()`, which sets
`zen-compact-animating` on `:root` and `animate="true"` on the toolbox and animates
the inline margin (`ZenCompactMode.mjs:173-201`, `475-628`). Scoped to a plain
`:root:not([zen-compact-mode="true"])`, this section therefore switches off a frame
*before* the slide starts: the panel and the gap disappear, then the bare sidebar
slides away. That is the jump.

The fix is to stay applied for the length of the handover:

```css
:root:is(:not([zen-compact-mode="true"]), [zen-compact-animating])
```

This is safe because every compact rule that would collide is itself behind
`:not([animate='true'])` — the `position: fixed`, the `#titlebar { visibility: hidden }`
and compact's own `.zen-toolbar-background { display: flex }` are all suppressed while
the animation runs, and `#zen-sidebar-splitter { display: none }` sits behind
`:not([zen-compact-animating])`. So during the overlap only this section applies, the
panel slides out with the sidebar, and compact takes over once the toolbox is already
off screen. Nothing in section 5 is touched.

Only the animated toggle is covered. Flipping `mod.safari.pinned-panel` itself is a
media-query change and snaps by definition.

### Why not just pin compact open

The obvious alternative is to leave compact mode on and force the panel to its
revealed position — `left: calc(var(--zen-compact-float) / -2) !important` plus
`#titlebar { visibility: visible }`. The render would be byte-identical, since it
would *be* the compact render. It was rejected for two reasons:

- The panel is `position: fixed`, so the page runs underneath it and space has to
  be reserved by hand. The width to reserve is `--actual-zen-sidebar-width`, which
  `ZenCompactMode.mjs:437` writes **inline on `#navigator-toolbox`** — it does not
  inherit into `#zen-tabbox-wrapper`, so a script would be needed just to mirror
  the number onto `:root`.
- `#zen-sidebar-splitter` is `display: none !important` in compact, so sidebar
  resizing disappears.

### Collapsed sidebar

The collapsed rail needs no width fixing. Compact has to bump
`--zen-toolbox-max-width` to 74px (`zen-compact-mode.css:108`) because its float is
padding on a box already capped at 60px; here the cap describes the same box and the
gap is padding inside it, so the panel simply lands where the tabs already fit.

The one thing carried over is that compact runs the collapsed rail with no inner
horizontal padding at all (`zen-compact-mode.css:190`, `var(--zen-toolbox-padding) 0`)
— a tab is already as wide as the rail — so `padding-inline` drops to the bare gap.

Nothing in this section writes to `#titlebar`, which matters more than it looks: the
collapsed layout fixes in `zen-tabs.css` are scoped to
`:root:not([zen-compact-mode='true'])`, so unlike in compact they are live, and one of
them reserves `padding-top: var(--zen-toolbar-height)` on `#titlebar` for the window
buttons. Leaving the element alone lets that clearance survive on its own.

### Section 5 rescoping

The reveal animation in section 5 used to match `#navigator-toolbox` globally even
though every rule in it is about compact's slide. Left alone it would put a
`transition: visibility 0.30s` on a toolbox that never moves. All five selectors
are now prefixed with `:root[zen-compact-mode="true"]`; the closing rule is still
less specific than the opening one, so the cascade inside compact is unchanged.

---

## 9. Site accent colour

`mod.safari.site-accent`, chrome.css section 11 plus `site-accent.uc.mjs` and an
actor pair. The sidebar takes the colour of the site you are on, in both modes.

### Where the colour comes from, and what does not help

A cascade: the favicon's dominant colour, then `<meta name="theme-color">`, then the
page's canvas colour, then the favicon's monochrome reading.

Two things that look like they would help, and do not:

- **`ZenGradientGenerator.getMostDominantColor` is a false friend.** It takes
  `workspaceTheme.gradientColors` — the dots the user placed in Zen's own gradient
  picker — and returns the one marked `isPrimary`, else the middle one
  (`ZenGradientGenerator.mjs:1489-1496`, `:1857-1867`). It never touches an image, a
  favicon or a page.
- **Firefox does not parse `<meta name="theme-color">` at all.** `ContentMetaChild`
  collects only description and preview-image tags; the Web App Manifest `theme_color`
  is a different spec, fetched on demand and only for Taskbar Tabs. That tier is the
  entire reason this feature needs an actor.

What is reusable is the *policy*, not the arithmetic: `contrastRatio` off
`window.gZenThemePicker`. The HSL conversions are local on purpose — Zen's `hslToRgb`
takes hue as a fraction while its `rgbToHsl` returns degrees, and a silent convention
mismatch there would be a wrong colour rather than an error.

### One decision per navigation

The tiers do not arrive in cascade order, and the first version applied each as it
came. On a navigation that meant: the actor's DOMContentLoaded report recomputed the
cascade with *no icon* and landed on the canvas — a grey — then the favicon arrived and
the sidebar moved again. Two or three cross-fades per navigation, and on a site whose
colour had not changed at all — Google search to Google search — a dip to grey and back.
Two facts about the icon in `tabbrowser.js` made that unavoidable from the old shape:

- When a new document commits, `onLocationChange` nulls `browser.mIconURL` but leaves
  the tab's `image` attribute alone "to avoid flickering" (`tabbrowser.js:10115-10123`).
  `gBrowser.getIcon()` is therefore empty for the whole load, and the attribute is the
  *previous* page's icon; neither says anything about the new document.
- `setIcon()` only fires `TabAttrModified` when the attribute's value changes
  (`tabbrowser.js:1528`). The same site's icon arriving again — every same-origin
  navigation — fires nothing. What it does fire, every time, is `onLinkIconAvailable`
  on the tabs-progress listeners (`tabbrowser.js:1548`), and that is the signal used.

So `site-accent.uc.mjs` keeps, per tab, the state of the current document — an epoch
bumped on every commit, the icon set and what it decoded to, the actor's last report
and its phase, whether the top-level load has stopped — and every signal re-runs one
function, `decide()`, which returns either "not yet" or an answer and whether it is
**final**. A chromatic favicon is final the moment it decodes. Everything below it
waits until the icon question is settled: decoded to nothing, or no icon coming. "No
icon coming" is the end of the top-level load (`STATE_STOP | STATE_IS_NETWORK`, the same
moment tabbrowser clears the attribute) with no `pendingicon` on the tab, plus a 400 ms
grace, because the icon's request can outlive the document's — measured on Google,
the stop came first and the old shape would have gone grey on it. `theme-color` is then
final at once; the canvas is final once the page has reached `load` (its stylesheets
are in) and a guess before that; the icon's monochrome reading is final; and "no
accent" is final only once the page has said its last word. A hard deadline of 4 s
applies the best available answer on a page that streams forever.

Only a final answer is applied, remembered for the origin, and used as the hold. While
the answer is pending the sidebar keeps its previous colour — so a new site cross-fades
once, when its own colour is known, typically 200–600 ms after the navigation and
absorbed by the transition. A page on an origin seen before takes that origin's colour
at the navigation itself, which is what makes moving around one site change nothing.
Measured: seven sites, one cross-fade each; zero on a same-origin navigation, a reload,
or a redirect chain.

What is remembered — per tab and per origin — is the **raw source colour**, not the
normalised accent. Normalisation depends on Zen's dark-mode decision, which a workspace
theme can flip without the system scheme moving; the script watches
`zen-should-be-dark-mode` on `:root` as well as `prefers-color-scheme`, and on either
re-normalises the selected tab's source without re-reading anything.

Two `about:blank`s that are not pages, both of which the first cut of this model took for
Zen's empty tab and faded the sidebar to the theme on: the initial document of a new
browser, and the one a process switch re-creates the browser at — every cross-site
navigation passes through the second. `onLocationChange` skips `about:blank` unless the
tab carries `zen-empty-tab`, and a tab at `about:blank` without it is held, not decided.

The child actor stamps every report with its phase — `meta`, `dcl`, `load` — and sends
the `load` one even when the colours repeat, since the parent is waiting for that word
before it trusts the canvas. It also answers `Accent:Get`, for a tab that was open
before the listener attached.

Two more things the trace turned up, both on GitHub:

- **A site can set its icon twice.** GitHub ships a light and a dark `<link rel="icon">`
  and `onLinkIconAvailable` fires for each, ~30 ms apart. The first decoded as
  "chromatic" with a winning bucket at saturation 0.16 — a handful of anti-aliased
  pixels on the edge of a monochrome mark — and the second as neutral, so the final
  answer moved from the icon to the theme-color a frame later. The scorer now also
  requires the winning bucket's *mean* saturation to clear 0.22, which makes both of
  GitHub's icons neutral, and a final answer taken from a chromatic icon is never
  demoted by a later non-icon decision, so a genuine light/dark pair cannot flip the
  sidebar either.
- **A new tab is at `about:blank` before its page commits**, and `seed()` used to read
  it as a loaded page with no icon: 420 ms later, if the page had still not committed
  (a slow site), "no accent" was final and the sidebar faded to the theme, then to the
  site. A tab at `about:blank` that is not the empty tab is now held with no state at
  all; `begin()` takes over when the document arrives.

`mod.safari.site-accent.debug` (hidden, boolean) logs every signal — navigate, icon,
page report, load stop — every decision with its tier and the state it was made from,
and every `show()` with its caller, to the console and to `safari-accent.log` in the
profile. One navigation should be one `decide` line and one `show`.

### The compositing knob

Do **not** overwrite `--zen-main-browser-background-toolbar`. Zen rewrites it inline
on every workspace change, drag frame and swipe frame (`ZenGradientGenerator.mjs:1730`,
`ZenSpaceManager.mjs:1852-1867`), its value is often a `linear-gradient` and so cannot
be transitioned, and replacing it kills the workspace crossfade.

The accent is stacked over it in the same shorthand instead:

```css
@property --safari-accent { syntax: "<color>"; inherits: true; initial-value: transparent; }

#zen-toolbar-background::after {
  background:
    linear-gradient(var(--safari-accent), var(--safari-accent)),
    var(--zen-main-browser-background-toolbar) !important;
  background-blend-mode: normal, screen !important;
}
```

Three things fall out of that shape:

- alpha 1 is a full replacement, alpha 0 is the untouched theme — so "this page has
  no accent" is the same animation running backwards, not a separate code path;
- Zen's crossfade still works, `::after` at `opacity: var(--zen-background-opacity)`
  and `::before` at `calc(1 - …)` untouched, both carrying the same accent;
- **`background-blend-mode: normal` on our layer.** The theme layers carry `screen`
  (`zen-browser-ui.css:66,79`), which only ever lightens; inheriting it washes the
  accent out. This is the difference between the colour being right and being
  approximately right.

`@property` works in this context — Zen uses it itself (`zen-boosts.css:598`) — and a
registered custom property is what makes the colour transitionable at all.

### Which element, in which mode

`#zen-toolbar-background` is `display: none` outside compact mode
(`zen-compact-mode.css:9`), lifted only inside `:root[zen-compact-mode='true']` — and
by section 10 of this file. So one element covers compact *and* pinned-with-panel, and
only stock pinned needs a second target: `#navigator-toolbox`, whose
`--zen-navigator-toolbox-background` hook Zen declares (`zen-browser-ui.css:12-16`) and
then never writes anywhere in the tree. That rule is excluded when section 10 is on,
where the toolbox background is already the page canvas behind the panel.

Tinting `#zen-browser-background` instead would be wrong: that element spans the whole
window, not the sidebar.

### Getting the colour right

The accent replaces hue and chroma but its **lightness is normalised into the band the
current scheme already occupies**. Taken literally, "the site's colour" paints a
`#ff0000` sidebar on YouTube with white labels on saturated red. Normalising means no
chrome text colour has to be touched, so nothing fights `ZenGradientGenerator`'s own
`zen-should-be-dark-mode` / `--toolbox-textcolor` writes.

Saturation is only pushed *up* when there is chroma to push (`s >= 0.08`). Clamping a
grey up to the floor would invent a hue that is in no part of the source — GitHub's
`#1f2328` would come out visibly blue.

**Translucency and "laid over the theme" are two different things.** Conflating them
cost two round trips.

First cut: the accent carried Zen's acrylic alpha (0.6 from
`getToolbarModifiedBaseRaw`) *and* sat on top of the workspace gradient, so 40% of the
gradient showed through and a blue site came out muddy purple-blue. Second cut: opaque,
which fixed the colour and killed the panel's `backdrop-filter` — most of what makes
the sidebar look like glass.

What was actually needed is translucent **and** not over the theme. While an accent is
showing, `:root` carries `[safari-accent]` and section 11 drops the theme layer
entirely, so what the accent reveals is the blur rather than the gradient.

**Then a scrim, because a raw blur is not a known quantity.** The same Telegram blue
reads 7.7:1 against white labels over a dark site and 2.9:1 over a white one — legible
on some sites and not on others, which is exactly the "not very readable" complaint.
A scrim at `SCRIM_ALPHA` settles the backdrop toward the scheme's own extreme before the
accent lands on it. It is the same job Zen's `brightness(0.25)` does inside its acrylic
filter — the one section 4 strips out for being a dark-mode hardcode.

The contrast loop then measures the **real composite in its worst case**: the accent
over the scrim over the least helpful page the site could put behind it, a white page
under dark chrome or a black one under light. And it measures the gradient end nearest
the text, not the midpoint — the sheen puts one end above the other either way, and
optimising the middle leaves that end short. With those two corrections every brand
colour tested clears 4.5:1 at both ends, worst case.

**The lightness is clamped, not blended.** Mixing 75% of a target lightness into the
source was the other half of "it barely tints". It landed every
site on roughly the same washed-out shade — the hue survived and everything that made
it recognisable did not. Clamping into a band leaves a source already inside it
completely alone:

| | dark chrome | light chrome |
|---|---|---|
| lightness band | 0.16 – 0.34 | 0.78 – 0.93 |
| saturation | clamped 0.28 – 0.80, and only when `s >= 0.08` | same |

The two ends are that band's value plus and minus `SHEEN`, lighter at the top — a
shallow vertical gradient in the site's own hue, which is the difference between
"coloured" and "finished".

### The transition has to live on `:root`

A registered custom property animates **on the element whose value changes**. A
descendant that merely inherits it receives the new value outright, however many
transitions are declared on the descendant.

The script writes `--safari-accent-top` / `-bottom` / `-scrim` to `:root`, so declaring
the transition on `#zen-toolbar-background::after` — where the colour is *used* — looked
right and did nothing at all: the colour jumped on every tab switch. The transition
belongs on `:root`, and everything below then inherits a value that is already moving.

`--safari-accent-scrim` is registered as a `<color>` for the same reason, and fades to
`rgba(…, 0)` rather than being dropped, so the theme is never revealed through a scrim
that is still darkening it. The `[safari-accent]` attribute that drops the theme layer
goes on at once when an accent arrives — the theme has to be gone before the accent is
composited over it — and comes off only `FADE_MS + 40` after the accent was cleared, so
the theme reappears under a colour that is already transparent. The scrim itself is
written by the script, not by `light-dark()` in CSS: that would resolve against the
chrome colour scheme rather than Zen's own dark-mode decision for the theme.

### Favicon scoring

Most-frequent-pixel is the wrong answer — it returns the icon's paper or its ink on
almost every favicon. So: drop `alpha < 128`, drop `l > 0.93` and `l < 0.07`, drop
`s < 0.15` (this is what makes a monochrome mark decline and fall through to the next
tier rather than producing a grey "accent"), bucket the survivors by hue in 24 bins
against a coarse saturation/lightness grid, score `count × (0.5 + s)` so a small vivid
mark beats a large dull field, and return the winning bucket's **mean** rather than its
centre, which is a quantisation artefact.

The downscale to 32×32 uses `resizeQuality: "pixelated"` deliberately: smooth
downscaling averages neighbouring pixels and invents hues that are in no part of the
icon.

**Getting the bytes needs two paths, and only having one was a real bug.** `fetch()`
handles `data:` and `http(s):` icons straight from cache, but Zen hands out
`moz-remote-image:` URLs for SVG favicons — a protocol for re-encoding an image safely —
and `fetch` cannot read those at all. That is not an edge case: it is why GitHub kept
showing the workspace gradient, and why Claude fell through to its page background
instead of taking the orange off its own mark. Places already holds the decoded bytes
for any icon it has seen, so `PlacesUtils.favicons.getFaviconForPage(browser.currentURI)`
→ `.rawData` is the fallback: local data, no protocol handler, no CORS.

A third path exists behind those two, and it is the one that catches what they cannot:
render the icon with an `<img>` in the chrome document and read the canvas back. That
resolves every scheme Zen hands out — `moz-remote-image:`, `page-icon:`, `data:` — and
rasterises an SVG that `createImageBitmap` refuses for having no intrinsic size. Reading
the pixels needs a system-principal document, which is what a `.uc.mjs` runs in.

**No miss is ever cached, at either level.** This was the bug behind "claude.com works,
claude.ai does not". A miss usually means the icon has not reached Places yet, or the
actor has not reported — and `remember(origin, null)` made that permanent for the
origin, so whichever domain happened to be unlucky on its first visit stayed colourless
for the session while its twin worked fine. Nothing about the site differed; only the
timing of the first look did.

For the same reason an icon that was set but would not decode gets one more attempt
after `RETRY_MS`; an icon that was already set before the listener attached — a
restored session, a background load — is read from `getIcon()` / the `image` attribute
when the tab is first seen.

When every tier declines, the reason is logged — which icon URL, whether it decoded,
what the actor said. A silent failure here is indistinguishable from the feature being
off, and that cost two rounds of guessing.

`chrome:`, `about:` and `resource:` icons are skipped — those are Zen's own defaults.

The scoring pass also returns a second, **neutral** reading: the mean of every opaque
pixel, chromatic or not. It is the last tier in the cascade, after the canvas. Without
it a site with no colour anywhere — a monochrome mark, no `theme-color`, and an actor
that has not reported yet — falls through to the workspace gradient, and a purple
sidebar on a flat grey site reads as the feature having simply failed. With it, a
monochrome site gets a monochrome sidebar, which is what it should have. Saturation is
only clamped upward when there is chroma to clamp (`s >= 0.08`), so a grey source stays
grey rather than having a hue invented for it.

### Why timing is a different problem here

The gutter feature in §8 has to land on a specific frame, which is why it needs the
content process to say when. This one *wants* a half-second cross-fade, so an accent
arriving a few frames early or late is absorbed by the transition rather than seen as a
jump — but only if it arrives *once*. The first version leaned on that and applied every
tier as it came, and the transition duly absorbed each of them into a visible wander.
The cross-fade buys tolerance on the moment, not on the count; the count is what the
decision model above is for.

## 10. chrome.css notes

The sections of `chrome.css` that are not covered above.

### 3 and 3b — inner padding

Compact's titlebar padding is Zen's own selector with per-side values instead of the
uniform `var(--zen-toolbox-padding)`:
`:root[zen-compact-mode="true"]:not([customizing]):not([inDOMFullscreen="true"])`
under `@media -moz-pref("zen.view.compact.hide-tabbar") or -moz-pref("zen.view.use-single-toolbar")`,
`&:not([zen-compact-animating]) #navigator-toolbox:not([animate="true"]) #titlebar`,
`padding: 2px 8px 8px 8px`. Section 3 targets `#titlebar` because that is the box
compact's panel covers. Pinned, the panel is inset inside the toolbox instead, so 3b
puts the same values on `#navigator-toolbox`, on top of the gap (which is padding there
too, section 10). Collapsed is left to section 10, which drops the horizontal padding
the way compact does.

### 6 — liquid glass search field

The values come from the ZenSidebar design and were verified by sampling the exported
PNG, each since lowered by two points:

| part | value |
|---|---|
| edge gradient (horizontal) | left 15 % → 8 % at 50 % → right 25 % white; light mode a flat 10.2 % black |
| fill (vertical) | top 5.1 % → bottom 10.2 % |
| dark inner glow | `inset 0 -4px 8px` white 5 % |
| light drop shadow | `0 4px 7px` black 5.9 % |

The stroke is outer-aligned in the design, so it is drawn by an `::after` at
`inset: -1px` with a masked 1px padding rather than a border, which would change the
field's metrics. `::before` is already Zen's (`smartbar.css:80`). Both shadows are
declared at once and the one that does not belong to the scheme is made transparent,
because `inset` cannot be switched by `light-dark()`. No `!important` is needed on the
`::after`: the mod creates it, so no author rule competes.

### 7 — tab hover

Two parts of one event on one timing (0.2s). The tab background has no transition at
all in Zen or Firefox — `--tab-background-color-hover` (`tabs.css:916`) and the selected
colour snap in — so it gets one, with `outline-color` alongside because Firefox switches
it on hover too. The buttons are the harder half: Zen reveals them with `display` alone
(`vertical-tabs.css:672-681`, `:902-906`). `transition-behavior: allow-discrete` keeps the
element displayed for the duration so it can fade out, and `@starting-style` gives it a
state to animate from on the way in; Firefox ships both in its own chrome CSS
(`tabs.css:1127`, `fullscreen-and-pointerlock.css:67`). The two hidden-state selectors are
exact complements of Zen's reveal conditions — close on `:hover` or
`[multiselected][selected]`, reset on `:hover` or `[visuallyselected]` — so no button Zen
keeps visible can end up faded out. Long enough to read as a fade, short enough that
running the pointer down a list of tabs leaves no smear.

### 9 — folder and chevron timing

Rides `--safari-folder-time` / `--safari-folder-ease` from `folder-motion.uc.mjs` (§5);
the fallbacks (`0.24s ease-out`) only apply before the script has run. The chevron's
opacity runs at 60 % of the duration.

### Origin and `!important`

Every rule in this file that touches a property Zen also declares needs `!important`:
Sine loads the sheet as a user sheet, and user-normal loses to author-normal (§8,
"Origin trap"). The two rules that create their own pseudo-element (section 6) are the
exception.

## 11. Method notes

Useful techniques if any of this needs re-verifying:

- **Corner geometry**: `screencapture -o -l<windowid>` captures a window with
  its alpha channel. Trace the first row-wise alpha crossing at 127.5 with
  linear interpolation, then least-squares fit against rasterised
  `CGPathCreateWithRoundedRect` / `CGPathCreateWithContinuousRoundedRect`
  candidates sampled through the *same* pipeline — comparing against analytic
  curves introduces a threshold bias that grows with radius.
- **AppKit internals**: `objc_copyClassList` + `class_copyMethodList` on a
  dlopened AppKit dumps the private API surface.
- **Which framework owns a symbol**: `dyld_info -exports <framework>` works
  directly on dyld-shared-cache frameworks.
- **Which selectors a build has**: parse the fat Mach-O, pick the arm64 slice,
  and search `__TEXT,__objc_methname` / `__objc_classname`. This is how
  `vibrancyViewsContainer` was confirmed to be a real selector.

## 12. Native Liquid Glass behind the pinned panel

`mod.safari.native-glass`, chrome.css section 12, `native-glass.uc.mjs` and
`native/SafariZenGlass.dylib` (Swift, `native/src`, built by `native/build.sh`).

The panel is a real `NSGlassEffectView`, placed **below Gecko's `ChildView`**
inside Zen's window at the panel's rect, with the panel's corner radius. Gecko
paints nothing in that rect, so its tabs, buttons and search field sit on the
glass, and the glass blurs what is behind the window. Nothing of the sidebar
is re-implemented natively.

Everything below was measured on macOS 26.5 with Zen 1.22b (Gecko 155.0.1),
Xcode 26.2, with the harness in §8 plus a window capture that composites the
window over what is behind it (`CGWindowListCreateImage` with
`kCGWindowListOptionOnScreenBelowWindow`, so windows on top do not matter).

### Gecko's surface is transparent where CSS paints nothing

`nsCocoaWindow::WidgetPaintsBackground()` returns `true` (`nsCocoaWindow.h:403`),
so `PresShell::ComputeBackstopColor` returns transparent on macOS, always. The
chrome root is themed `-moz-mac-window` (`global.css:14`), which
`nsNativeThemeCocoa` draws as nothing — the window's own background colour is
"the OS-level clear colour" the theme relies on. So every pixel Gecko writes
where no CSS layer paints is alpha 0, and the window frame (or Zen's material
view) is what shows through.

The proof was a red backing view under the ChildView: with the panel column
stripped of its backgrounds, the whole column came up red *under* the tabs,
the search field and the window buttons. At the panel's centre the layers
are `#zen-browser-background::after` (the workspace gradient, 40 % black in
the default theme), the mod's toolbox background, and the panel's
`::before`/`::after` theme pair at 0.6 alpha with acrylic — the toolbox
background was the only opaque one.

### Specificity, again

Stripping the toolbox background at first did nothing, for the reason in §8:
Sine's sheet is user origin, both rules are `!important`, and section 10's
selector is `:root:is(…):not(…):not(…) #navigator-toolbox` — (1,4,0). A bare
`#navigator-toolbox` in the same sheet loses. Section 12 keys everything off
`:root[safari-native-glass]:is(…):not(…):not(…)`, one attribute higher, and its
empty-tab rule nests `:root[zen-has-empty-tab="true"] &` to clear section
10's nested wash, which is higher still.

### Behind-window sampling needs two things

With the glass in place and the column transparent, the panel was a flat grey.
The matrix, panel pixel sampled on a dark page over a purple wallpaper:

| window | Zen material view | glass | panel pixel |
|---|---|---|---|
| opaque | present | none | (43,42,46) — the material, flat |
| opaque | present | regular / clear | (44,44,46) / (56,55,58) |
| non-opaque | present | clear | (56,55,58) — no change |
| non-opaque | present | none | (43,42,46) |
| non-opaque | **absent** | none | (15,17,29) — **the wallpaper** |
| non-opaque | absent | clear / regular | (40,42,52) / (37,38,45) — **glass over the wallpaper** |
| opaque | absent | regular | (43,42,46) — flat again |

So:

1. **The window must be non-opaque.** The window server only composites what
   is behind an opaque window's pixels when the window says it has alpha.
   `isOpaque = NO` and a clear `backgroundColor`; the rounded corners survive
   (corner pixels were wallpaper in every state).
2. **Zen's `ZenWindowMaterialView` is in the way.** It is the window's content
   view — an `NSVisualEffectView` with a behind-window material
   (`zen.widget.macos.window-vibrancy`, material from
   `zen.widget.macos.window-material`; the user's profile has 1, HUD) — and the
   glass samples *it*. It gets a `maskImage` with the panel's hole cut out,
   regenerated whenever the geometry changes (a 9-slice with `capInsets` past
   the hole's corners so a stretch between updates keeps the corners right).
   The material itself did not change look when the window went non-opaque,
   so nothing else in the window moves.

The material view is swapped for a plain `NSView` when the vibrancy pref
flips (Zen's `nsCocoaWindow::UpdateWindowMaterial`); the dylib re-mounts its
views and re-masks on every geometry call, and the script re-schedules one on
that pref. Without a material view the frame no longer paints the window colour
in a non-opaque window, so a base layer in `NSColor.windowBackgroundColor`
(with the same hole) is painted under everything instead, permanently while
attached, and re-resolved on appearance change.

### The window keeps going opaque again

Setting `isOpaque = NO` natively held for exactly as long as nothing restyled
`:root`. `nsIFrame::DidSetComputedStyle` calls
`PresShell::SetNeedsWindowPropertiesSync()` for **any** root-element style
change (`nsIFrame.cpp:1365`), and `SyncWindowPropertiesIfNeeded` then calls
`windowWidget->SetTransparencyMode(nsLayoutUtils::GetFrameTransparency(canvas, root))`
— Gecko 155's Cocoa `SetTransparencyMode` has no popup-only guard and sets
`opaque`/`backgroundColor` on any window. A themed root is `Opaque`
(`nsNativeThemeCocoa::GetWidgetTransparency` says so for `-moz-mac-window`),
so the very attribute the script sets to switch the CSS put the window back.

`GetFrameTransparency` (`nsLayoutUtils.cpp:6819`) checks, in order: root
opacity < 1, **a non-zero root border radius**, then the theme, then the
background. Section 12 gives `:root[safari-native-glass-host]` a
`border-radius: 0.1px`; the root paints nothing that a radius could change,
and from then on Gecko itself keeps the window non-opaque through every
restyle. On the way back Gecko sets the background to **white**, not the
window colour, so the script removes the attribute and detaches a frame later,
and the dylib restores the colour it saved at attach. `safari-native-glass-host`
lives from attach to detach; `safari-native-glass` only while the glass is
showing (pinned, not compact, not customizing, not DOM fullscreen).

### What Gecko paints instead

- **The gap** moved from the toolbox background to a spread `box-shadow` on the
  panel: `0 0 0 var(--safari-pin-gap) var(--safari-pin-canvas)`. It follows
  the panel's corners, its outer arc at radius 19 + 7 = 26 coincides with the
  window's own corner, and it is Gecko-painted in the same frame as the page
  placeholder, so §8's colour timing is untouched. The empty tab's wash rides
  the same variable. The page-facing side has no gap and the ring runs 7px
  under the page, which is above the toolbox. `--zen-big-shadow` stays first
  in the list so the panel keeps its depth in the gap.
- **The workspace gradient** is clipped out of the panel with
  `clip-path: path(evenodd, …)` on `#zen-browser-background`, the hole drawn
  by the script with Apple's continuous corner (three cubics per corner, the
  §1 coefficients), in that element's own box.
- **The theme / accent tint** on the panel's `::before`/`::after` stays,
  scaled by `--safari-glass-tint` (0.35) with the §2 crossfade formula, and
  the 1px outline goes: the glass has its own rim.
- Panel `background` and `backdrop-filter` are off.

### Geometry

The script feeds CSS-pixel rects from `getBoundingClientRect()` and
`devicePixelRatio`; the dylib converts through the window's
`backingScaleFactor` and flips y against the ChildView's frame. The native
radius is the concentric one from §1 (window radius minus the gap, 19 with
the defaults; the CSS pseudos use the superellipse equivalent) or the panel's
own radius without the native window radius. Updates are coalesced to one per
animation frame from a `ResizeObserver` on the panel and the toolbox, a root
attribute observer (compact, right side, customizing, fullscreen, window
radius) and `resize`; between updates an autoresizing mask keeps the glass
the window's height during a live resize. The hole is inset 0.5px inside the
glass so no sliver of the material shows at the edge.

### Loading the library

- Zen's entitlements include `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation`,
  so an ad-hoc-signed dylib loads; `build.sh` signs it.
- Sine installs a mod by downloading the repository zip
  (`codeload.github.com`, `ucAPI.unpackRemoteArchive`) and extracting with
  `nsIZipReader`, so the binary arrives intact. The path is resolved from
  `import.meta.url` through the chrome registry to the profile's
  `sine-mods/<id>/native/`.
- The window is `nsIBaseWindow.nativeHandle` — the `NSWindow*` as a hex string
  — cast with ctypes; the dylib also accepts a view.
- The macOS 26 SDK is needed to *build* (the Command Line Tools' SDK 15 has no
  `NSGlassEffectView.h`; `DEVELOPER_DIR` points `build.sh` at Xcode). The
  dylib runs on macOS 12+ and falls back to an `NSVisualEffectView` sidebar
  material with a rounded `maskImage` where the glass class is missing.
- `-moz-pref()` in chrome.css is false for a pref that does not exist, and
  Sine writes defaults from its settings page, not on install: the script
  writes the two prefs itself if they are absent.

### Not done

- The site accent could be the glass's own `tintColor` instead of a CSS layer
  over it; it would need the script to sample `--safari-accent-*` through
  their 0.5s transition and push each frame.
- Compact mode keeps the CSS acrylic panel: the native view cannot follow
  Zen's slide animation without a per-frame sync.
