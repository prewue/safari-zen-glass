# Safari-like Zen

A [Sine](https://github.com/CosmoCreeper/Sine) mod that makes Zen Browser feel
like Safari on macOS: native window corners, a floating translucent sidebar
that takes the colour of the site you are on, and motion with a bit of spring.

## Install

In Zen, open **Settings → Mods**, add a mod from GitHub and paste:

```
prewue/safari-zen
```

Then turn on Sine's JS switch (below), fully quit Zen (**⌘Q**) and reopen it.

Needs Zen with Sine. The native window corners need macOS 26; everything else
works wherever Zen runs.

### Enable JS in Sine

Sine only runs a mod's scripts if the mod comes from its store or you have
allowed JS from other sources. This mod is installed from GitHub, so:

1. Open Zen **Settings → Sine** (the mods page).
2. Under **General**, turn on **Enable installing JS from unofficial sources**.
3. Fully quit Zen (**⌘Q**) and reopen it.

Without it the CSS parts still work — the sidebar shape, blur, glass field,
tab hover and reveal animation — but these do not:

| Needs JS | What you get without it |
|---|---|
| Native window corners, flush content edges | Zen's default corners and 8px content gap |
| Sidebar follows the site | Nothing; the sidebar keeps your workspace colour |
| Pinned sidebar's page-coloured gap | The panel still floats, over a flat light/dark gap |
| Folder motion, space swipe blur | Zen's own folder timing, no blur |

## What it does

- **Native window corners.** macOS's own window shape, like every native app.
- **Floating translucent sidebar.** Zen's translucency with a softer blur, a
  7px float from the window edge, and corners that follow the window's own
  curve concentrically.
- **Pinned sidebar with the compact panel.** With compact mode off, the
  sidebar keeps compact's floating panel but stays put, the page sits beside
  it, and the gap around the panel takes the page's own background colour.
- **Native Liquid Glass panel.** The panel's own background, blur and tint are
  dropped and a native `NSGlassEffectView` is placed behind the sidebar, inside
  Zen's window, at the panel's rounded rect, over the page's own colour. No
  tint, no theme wash, and nothing shows through the window. Works pinned and
  in compact mode as the sidebar slides in on hover. Regular or clear glass, in
  the settings.
- **Sidebar follows the site.** The sidebar takes the site's colour — from its
  favicon, its `theme-color` or its page background — once per navigation,
  cross-fading between sites. Replaces your workspace colour on the sidebar.
- **Liquid glass search field.**
- **Motion.** A spring reveal for the sidebar, folders that open as one, a tab
  hover fade, and a blur on the space you swipe away from. All of it respects
  the system "reduce motion" setting.

## Settings

Everything is an on/off switch in **Settings → Mods → Safari-like Zen**. Two of
them — the native window corners and the native translucent sidebar — need a
full restart (**⌘Q**) after changing.

To change the window corner radius, edit `RADIUS` in `window-radius.uc.mjs`
(26 is the macOS default; 20, 15 and 10 also look right); the sidebar's corners
follow it. The sidebar's float is the first rule in `chrome.css`.

## Uninstall

Remove the mod in **Settings → Mods**. On macOS, restore the default window
corners once:

```sh
defaults delete app.zen-browser.zen NSConvolutionOverride1
```

## Note

On macOS this mod runs `/usr/bin/defaults` from privileged browser code to set
the window corner radius, and loads a small native library
(`native/SafariZenGlass.dylib`, Swift, source and build script in `native/`)
into the browser process to place the glass. Zen quarantines every file it writes, so
the mod clears the quarantine flag from that library with `/usr/bin/xattr`
before loading it. Install it only if you're happy with that.
